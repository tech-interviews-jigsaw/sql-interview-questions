    "If we look at an artist by contrast, there is no foreign key in the artists table.  So, by contrast, we can find an artist like paul simon's songs by finding all records with a matching `artist_id` of 1.  So to review, placing the artist_id on the songs table means that a song has just one artist.  And because there is no foreign key on artists, and artist can have many songs."
